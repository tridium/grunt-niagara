# grunt-niagara

> Common Grunt tasks for Niagara modules

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~1.0.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out
the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it
explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as
well as install and use Grunt plugins.

```shell
npm install grunt-niagara --save-dev
```

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-niagara');
```

If you are creating a brand new Niagara web module, consider using
[grunt-init-niagara](https://github.com/tridium/grunt-init-niagara) to get
up and running quickly.

## Using grunt-niagara

`grunt-niagara` provides no custom tasks of its own. Instead, it loads other
tasks and smart default configurations for those tasks into your project. To
see these tasks, after following the steps above, type `grunt usage`.

## A bare minimum config

Most of the tasks provided require Grunt configurations of their own.
`grunt-niagara` will provide default configurations that reflect Niagara
recommended practices, so the required configuration is kept to a minimum and
you can get on with developing!

Almost all the tasks only require a `src` property with the files needed.
These can easily be shared among the different tasks.

If you don't wish to use a certain task, just leave its configuration object
out of the grunt config and grunt-niagara will disable it.

Additional options provided will override the defaults, so your own
configuration can be as specific as you need. This is just a minimum to get
started.

```js
var SRC_FILES = [
      'src/rc/**/*.js',
      '!src/rc/**/*.min.js'
    ],
    TEST_FILES = [
      'srcTest/rc/**/*.js'
    ],
    ALL_FILES = SRC_FILES.concat(TEST_FILES);

module.exports = function runGrunt(grunt) {
  grunt.initConfig({
    pkg: grunt.file.readJSON('package.json'),

    jsdoc:     { src: SRC_FILES },
    eslint:    { src: ALL_FILES },
    watch:     { src: ALL_FILES },
    karma:     {},
    babel:     {},
    requirejs: {},
    niagara:   {
      station: {
        forceCopy: true,
        sourceStationFolder: './srcTest/stations/bajauxUnitTest'
      }
    }
  });

  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-niagara');
};
```

## Notes about default behavior

### `jsdoc`
 
Generates JSDocs and places them in `jsdoc-dir`.

**Minimal config:**

`src`: array of file definitions to process for JSDoc

### `eslint`

Performs ESLint analysis and fails the build if any errors are found. Error
report will be placed in `eslint-reports-dir`.

Tip: If running ESLint direct from the command line, type `eslint:src` to get
output formatted for display. Type `eslint:fix` to automatically fix all
fixable errors.

**Minimal config:**

`src`: array of file definitions to analyze with ESLint.

### `karma`

Runs browser-based unit tests. Its default starting point will be to execute JS
found at `srcTest/rc/browserMain.js`. Test reports will be placed in
`junit-reports-dir`, and code coverage reports (if running `grunt ci`) will be
placed in `coverage-reports-dir`.

If `niagara.station` config is present, it will start a station prior to running
tests.

**Minimal config:**

No configuration necessary. An empty object will enable Karma tests.

### `babel`

As of `grunt-niagara` 2.0, Babel transpilation is provided out of the box. This
will enable you to use ES6 syntax features in your code and have them transpiled
down to ES5 for browser compatibility.

If enabled, by default, all JS files in `src/rc` and `srcTest/rc` will be
transpiled into the `build` directory for packaging into the final JAR. In
conjunction, Karma will look in `build/karma` to run tests against the
transpiled files. (If using `grunt-init-niagara`, check your paths config in
`browserMain.js` to ensure RequireJS is looking in `build/karma`.)

The transpilation can be configured using the `sourceMappings` property as
described below.

**Minimal config:**

No configuration necessary. An empty object will enable the default
transpilation behavior.

### `copy`

You may want certain files to be copied directly into the JAR without any sort
of linting or testing, such as third-party libraries you did not create. The
default behavior is to simply copy over any non-JS files in `src/rc` and
`srcTest/rc`, and any files at all in `src/ext` and `srcTest/ext`. Remember to
include these `ext` directories in your Gradle file if needed.

**Minimal config:**

No configuration necessary - will always be available.

### `niagara.station`

Configures a station to start up for Karma tests. See the `niagara-station` npm
module.

### `pkg`

Reads the contents of `package.json`. This is required for `grunt-niagara` to
function.

### `requirejs`

Performs r.js optimization. By default, it will include every .js file under
`src/rc` and place the optimized file at
`build/src/rc/{moduleName}.built.min.js`.

It will map `nmodule/yourModuleName` to the `src` directory. This conforms to
the Niagara RequireJS module ID convention, where `nmodule` maps to a URL
starting with `/module`. Therefore a file at `src/rc/foo.js` should map to
the RequireJS ID `nmodule/yourModuleName/rc/foo`.

RequireJS plugins `baja!`, `css!`, `log!`, and `lex!` will be disabled during
the build, as they only make sense in the context of a running station. To
configure this list, set your `disablePlugins` option to an array of plugin
names (omitting the '!'). Other common Niagara modules like `bajaux` and
`Promise` will be excluded using the `empty:` syntax. Handlebars templates will
be compiled using the copy of Handlebars from the `js` module jar.

One build task named `src` will be present, so you can override default behavior
like this:

```
require: {
  src: {
    options: {
      include: [ 'nmodule/myModule/rc/OnlyThisOneModule' ],
      out: 'build/src/rc/differentTargetFile.built.min.js'
    }
  },
  anotherBuild: {
    options: { /* ... */ }
  }
}
```

Or, if you wish to "cancel out" the `src` build and configure all your builds
by hand, just set it to a falsy value:

```
require: {
  src: false,
  myOwnBuild: {
    options: { /* ... */ }
  }
}
```

**Minimal config:**

No configuration necessary. An empty object will allow r.js optimization as
described.

### `watch`

Starts up in watch mode, performing ESLint analysis and running Karma tests
every time you save a file.

If you want to customize which Grunt tasks are run when you save a file, pass
a function as a `tasks` parameter like this:

```
watch: {
  src: SRC_FILES,
  tasks: function (defaultTasks) {
    // the default tasks run ESLint followed by Karma.
    return [ 'run-first' ].concat(defaultTasks).concat([ 'run-after' ]);
  }
}
```

As of `grunt-niagara` 2.0, the `watch` task will be configured to run linting
and transpilation only on those files which were actually changed, which will
help speed up development. To disable this behavior so *all* files are linted
and transpiled on every change, set the `onDemand` option to `false`:

```
watch: {
  options: { onDemand: false },
  src: SRC_FILES
}
```

By default, Babel will perform one full run when starting up watch mode. This
will ensure that all files are correctly transpiled (otherwise files that were
changed while watch was not running, such as when pulling from source control,
would be missed). To skip this initial Babel run, pass the option
`--quick-start=true`.

**Minimal config:**

`src`: array of file definitions that will trigger a test run when saved.

### `sourceMappings`

`grunt-niagara` provides transpilation and RequireJS optimization out of the
box. These functions also make some assumptions about the structure of your
module (the same structure we use at Tridium):

- All JS to be transpiled lives in `src/rc`
- All CSS, HTML, images, etc. to be used as-is also live in `src/rc`
- All test code lives in `srcTest/rc`
- All external dependencies live in `src/ext`, or `srcTest/ext` for test-only
  dependencies - these are to be used without modification

But you may wish to retrofit `grunt-niagara` to an existing module, and you may
not want to move all your files around to conform to these conventions. You can
point `grunt-niagara` at different directories using the `sourceMappings`
config. You can build this by hand, but the `gruntSources` module includes some
APIs that will make this much easier.

Please note that customization is not unlimited - all transpilation must target
`build/src` or `build/srcTest` or their subdirectories.

An example is below:

```
const { allFiles, allJsFiles, allFilesWithoutExtensions } = require('grunt-niagara/lib/gruntSources');

///...
sourceMappings: {
  // say my ES6 code lives in src/es6, not src/rc...
  source: allJsFiles().from('src/es6').to('build/src/es6'),

  // ...and my css and images aren't in src/rc, they're in src/com/mycompany instead...
  resources: allFilesWithoutExtensions([ 'js', 'java' ]).from('src/com/mycompany').to('build/src/com/mycompany'),

  // ... and i put my third party dependencies in src/lib instead of src/ext.
  ext: allFiles().from('src/lib').to('build/src/lib')

  // the corresponding test properties are test, testResources, and testExt
}
```

## Global Options

If you would like to customize the default values for command-line options, you
can do so using an options configuration file by using the `options`
command-line argument.

```
grunt <task> --options="optionsFile.json"
```

The default value is `<niagara_user_home>/etc/my-grunt-options.json`, so you can
place a JSON file in this location and it will always be used. In order to
override something such as `station-log-level`, you could use a `JSON` file like
this:

```JSON
{
  "station-log-level": "INFO"
}
```

## Global Config

As with options, you can also override Grunt configuration globally using the
`config` command-line argument.

```
grunt <task> --config="configFile.json"
```

The default value is `<niagara_user_home>/etc/my-grunt-config.json`. The JSON
will be merged in with the Grunt config before running any tasks, so you can add
any configuration you like. In order to override something such as adding a
custom Karma launcher, you would use a `JSON` file like this:

```JSON
{
  "karma": {
    "options": {
      "customLaunchers": {
        "MyCustomLauncher": {
          "base": "ChromeHeadless",
          "displayName": "My Custom Launcher"
        }
      }
    },
    "ci": {
      "browsers": [ "MyCustomLauncher" ]
    }
  }
}
```
